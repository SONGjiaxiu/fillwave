[Fillwave] is a modern, native and totally free rendering engine writen in c++14.

Can be used in any 3D games, apps and visualization tools or as a regular part of your game engine.

- Multiplatform (Linux, Windows, Android, OSX)
- Native Android apps (JNI, or C++).
- Using the greatest open source libraries (Ex. glm for math and assimp for assets)
- OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenGL 3.3+ support with programmable pipeline
- Engine can be fully open source and free under BSD license

- All models placed in examples/linux/data are various models which I found across internet.
  I was looking only for free ones in case of which the license permits for placing them here.
  If your work is placed here, please write to me and i will change it or remove it.
